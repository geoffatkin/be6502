# Geoff's be6502 computer
Code and other info for a Ben Eater style 65c02-based computer I'm building.

Project layout:
* early-days: code from a version closer to Ben's original design
* prototype: code and wiring diagram for the prototype

A few files include ideas I wanted to try out but have since 
decided to discard. (In particular, early-days/word-macros and
prototype/registers are not my strategy moving forward.)

Current prototype:
